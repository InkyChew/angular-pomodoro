# Pomodoro
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that breaks down work into intervals, traditionally 25
minutes in length, separated by 1 short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro. After completing four
pomodoros, you take a longer break, usually 15-30 minutes. This method helps improve focus, reduce distractions,
and increase productivity.
